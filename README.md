# DataDriven_ESG_Investing_Project

## Introduction
ESG investing, also known as “socially responsible investing” or “sustainable investing”,  refers to investing that prioritizes optimal Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors or outcomes. Investment management organizations need the data required to make investment decisions following Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) regulatory standards. 

This project aims to fill the data gap using web scraping technique and Natural Language Process (NLP) to synthesize the required ESG information. Also produce actionable insights and benchmark to ESG standards, allowing for investment decisions using novel sources of data.
